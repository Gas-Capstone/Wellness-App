# Upkeep: An open-source, low friction wellness app for Android
Upkeep is a wellness app designed to keep track of workouts, meals, and habits app, with the intention of being as easy to use as possible. The project is currently early in development.

## Create a dev build
##### Note: This guide assumes you have an Android device with debugging enabled, or an Android emulator already set up. Guides for this can be found in the [Expo Build Docs](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&buildEnv=local&platform=android&device=physical). Follow the Development Build guide.
#### Prerequisites
- Nodejs (LTS)
- JDK 17+
- Android 16+ SDK

1. Clone repo, and run install:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Install the build client:
```bash
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```
3. Plug in your Android device, or start your Android emulator, and build and run the app:
```bash
npx expo run:android
```
4. You won't need to build the app again, unless more Nodejs packages are installed. To run the server without rebuilding the app:
```bash
npx expo start
```
